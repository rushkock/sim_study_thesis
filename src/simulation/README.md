# Simulation study

This folder contains the code used to run the simulation study


### Prerequisites

This code was written using Rstudio.
In requirements.txt are the libraries necessary to run the simulation.
They can be download using packages.install("name").
Alternatively the code to download them can be uncommented in Preparation.R.

### Structuur (Structure)

Alle Python scripts staan in de folder Code, waarbij de algoritmen in hun aparte map staan. In de map results zullen de resultaten per algoritmen geplaatst worden.

### Test

To run the simulation use the following command

```
source(main.R)
```

However, this code is not directly executable as the author has working directories and paths hard coded
